Hi there!

I'm [Navie Narula](http://navierula.github.io/) and I'm currently a masters student at Columbia University, studying journalism and computer science.

I was first exposed to R in a class I took at the journalism school, and am now working to analyze interesting datasets using the language. Last semester, I visualized and classified real and fake news headlines. You can check out my [code](https://github.com/navierula/language-in-real-and-fake-news/blob/master/analysis.ipynb) and [report](http://navierula.github.io/papers/narula_newsheadlines.pdf) for that project, if you'd like.

I wanted to share with you another project that I'm currently working on - analyzing adjective polarity in movie reviews. I'm having lots of fun it with it so far, and hope to continue taking more advantage of the tidyverse as I go!

You'll find my code in my Jupyter notebook titled "data-analysis." 

Thanks for taking the time to learn more about me, my work, and my passion for working with data to tell stories!
