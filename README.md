Hi there!

I'm [Navie Narula](http://navierula.github.io/) and I'm currently a masters student at Columbia University, studying journalism and computer science.

I was first exposed to R in a class I took at the journalism school, and am now working to analyze interesting datasets using the language. Last semester, I visualized and classified real and fake news headlines. You can check out my [code](https://github.com/navierula/language-in-real-and-fake-news/blob/master/analysis.ipynb) and [report](http://navierula.github.io/papers/narula_newsheadlines.pdf) for that project, if you'd like. I also wrote a [paper](http://navierula.github.io/papers/narula_subreddits.pdf) and some [code](https://github.com/navierula/Subreddit-Analysis-on-Eating-Disorders/blob/master/corTestsandSummaries.R) about language used by people who have
eating disorders, in which I did some of my preliminary analysis using R!

I wanted to share with you another project that I'm currently working on - analyzing adjective polarity in movie reviews. The point of me sharing this project in its early stages is so that you may get an idea of how my thought process works when it comes to looking at a new dataset. I'm having lots of fun it with it so far, and hope to continue taking more advantage of the tidyverse as I go! 

You'll find my code in my Jupyter notebook titled "[data_analysis](https://github.com/navierula/adjective-polarity-analysis/blob/master/data_analysis.ipynb)".

Thanks for taking the time to learn more about me, my work, and my passion for working with data to tell stories!
